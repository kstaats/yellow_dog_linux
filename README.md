# Yellow Dog Linux

"From 1999 through 2008 I was CEO of Terra Soft Solutions, developer of Yellow Dog Linux (YDL) for the POWER 
architecture. We were renowned for our clear, concise guides to installation and Getting Started book which enjoyed
four editions. I have included here, more for nostalgia than real function or value the last version of the Guide
to Installation and the first chapter of the Getting Started with Yellow Dog Linux book (as versions 3 and 4 were
lost).

It is my intent to some day return to the Indesign doc and refresh the first chapter on using the command line as 
it is once again in vogue to learn Linux, Python, and command line interfaces as the most efficient, effective way
to move and manipulate data in a world of machin learning." --kai
